    title: We're Creative
    content: Over two decades spent in accounting and financial analysis have taught
      me that there is more than one way to solve a problem.  I am able to build a
      QuickBooks chart of accounts and utilize categories lists to create reporting
      that will help you focus on what drives the success of your business.
